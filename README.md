Hydro EU: Visualizing Renewable Energy Production Across Europe 
Background 
Hydro   EU,   headquartered   in   Milan,   Italy, stands   as   Europe’s   leading   producer   of   clean   and renewable energy, with a focus on   hydroelectric   power generation.   The company manages   a   vast and diverse   portfolio of hydroelectric power   plants spread   across   the   continent,   ranging      from small run-of-river installations to large-scale   pumped   storage facilities. 
As   Hydro   EU   has   grown   over   the   years, so   has   the complexity of managing its widespread assets.   The   company’s power plants vary   greatly   in terms   of capacity, type, and geographical location.   Some   are   situated   in   mountainous   regions with   high dams and   large reservoirs, while others are   located   on   rivers with   a   steady   flow.   This   diversity, while   a   strength in terms of energy   production flexibility, presents significant challenges in terms of asset   management,   strategic planning, and operational optimization.
Recognizing the complexity of their asset management,   Hydro   EU sought assistance from a data visualization team to develop   a system that would provide a comprehensive overview of their operations.   The   goal was   to      create an interactive, visual representation of their entire   hydroelectric   portfolio,   leveraging   the wealth of data they had accumulated about   each   power   plant.
What Problem is Data Visualization Helping to Solve? 
The   primary challenge faced   by   Hydro   EU was the lack of a unified,   easily   comprehensible   view of their asset status across   Europe.   This deficiency led to   several   operational   issues:
1.    Inefficient   Planning:   Without a clear overview, scheduling   maintenance and   managing   power distribution became unnecessarily complex and time-consuming.
2.    Communication Gaps:   Stakeholders at various levels of the organization struggled   to
access and understand the current status of assets,   leading to   potential   misunderstandings   and   inefficiencies.
3.      Suboptimal   Decision-Making:   The absence of a comprehensive view made   it difficult for
management to   make   informed, strategic decisions about asset utilization   and   maintenance prioritization.
4.    Potential for   Human   Error:   Relying on disparate sources of   information   increased the
risk of overlooking critical maintenance needs or   mismanaging   power   distribution.
What Data Can Be Used? 
To create an effective visualization system,   Hydro   EU compiled and   provided   access   to   a
comprehensive dataset of their hydroelectric power plants   across   Europe.   The   dataset   includes   the following key   information:
1.   Asset   Identification:   Unique   identifier   for   each   power   plant   (id),   Name   of   the   power   plant (name), Associated   IDs   from   other   databases   (pypsa_id, GEO, WRI)
2.    Location   Data:   Country   code   (ISO   3166-1 alpha-2)   (country_code),   Latitude   and   longitude in   decimal   degrees   (lat,   lon) 
3.    Power   Generation   Capacity:    Installed   electrical   power   generation   capacity 代 写INFS6023 Data Visualisation for ManagersR

4.    Plant   Characteristics:   Type   of   power   plant   according   to   Dispa-SET   classification   (type), Dam   height   in   meters   (dam   height_m),   Reservoir   volume   in   million   cubic   meters   (volume_Mm3), Storage capacity   in   MWh (storage capacity_MWh)
A comprehensive data dictionary can be   found   in   the Appendix.
This rich dataset allows for a comprehensive visualization that   not   only   shows   the   current   state of Hydro   EU’s assets but also   enables   detailed   analysis   and   planning.
Any Challenges That Had To Be Overcome? 
The development and   implementation of the data visualization system for   Hydro   EU   presented   several challenges:
Scalability was an   issue that   had to be overcome.   Designing a   system that   could   handle   and   display data for thousands of assets across   Europe without compromising performance   or user experience was a major technical   challenge.
Data security was crucial.   Given the sensitive nature of energy   infrastructure   information, implementing robust security   measures to protect the data while   still   allowing   necessary   access   was crucial. 
Adoption of the data visualisation system among technology-resistant users was slow.   Overcoming   resistance to change and ensuring widespread adoption of the   new system   across   different departments and levels of the organization required a   comprehensive   training   and   change   management approach. 
To address these challenges,   Luca   Moretti and   his data visualization team worked   closely with   Hydro   EU’s   IT department, conducted multiple stakeholder workshops, and   implemented an agile development   process with regular feedback loops.   The   resulting system   not   only   met the initial requirements but also   provided   a foundation for future   enhancements   and   data-driven   decision-making at   Hydro   EU.
