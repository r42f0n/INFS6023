Data Visualisation for Managers 
(INFS6023) 
Individual Assignment
Assessment Details 
The purpose of this assignment   is to enable   students:
•    Develop   knowledge of key   Data Visualisation (DV) concepts and   understand   related   challenges.
•   Apply   principles and   best   practices to develop data visualisations based on   real world   datasets.
•    Enhance research, critical thinking skills, and   solution   development   skills.
This assignment has   two   parts:
•    Part   1:   Answers   for   questions:    1, 2, and   3
•    Part   2:   Answers   for   questions:    1 (Business   Understanding), 2 (Data   Understanding),   and   3   (Visualisation)
Tasks 
Part 1 
Read the   Hydro   EU case (posted on canvas).   Additionally, conduct   independent   research on the topic of ‘clean and renewable energy   production’   and find   an   “interactive”   visualisa-tion corresponding to any one of the mentioned   problems that   data visualization   is   helping   to   solve.   Then, answer the following questions related to the visualisation: 
1.    Provide   the   Internet   link   (url) to   the   visualisation.   Explain   which   problem   of   clean   and renewable energy   production the data visualization is helping   to   solve.
2.    Use   data   visualisation   frameworks   and   decision   contexts   discussed   in   weeks   1   and   2   to analyse the visualisation.
3.    Critically reflect on the visualisation using visual grammars.   Provide   three   examples   of good practices used in the visualisation.   Then   identify three   areas   for   improvement.
Part 2 
Read   the   Hydro   EU   case   (posted   on   canvas).   Then, answer   the   following:
1.    Business   Understanding:   Conduct   independent research on the topic to understand
the business   model of renewable energy providers   specifically   in   the   hydro   power field.   Describe your understanding of the business   model.
2.    Data   Understanding:   Use   Tableau   data   visualisation   to   conduct   exploratory   data   anal-
ysis (EDA). Specifically focus on the features that you   believe   are   most   relevant to   the business   model of a   hydro   power provider.
3.   Visualisation:   Develop a Tableau   Dashboard to   present unique and significant   insights   that help solve the companies problems.   Provide   a justification of the design   decisions   you made when developing the dashboard.    Include a screenshot of the dashboard (only)   in   the   report   (max   one   page).
Notes 
•    Do   not   present all your charts   in the dashboard, display only what   you   believe   would   be   most   interesting to the senior management of a hydro   power   company.
•    No   written   text   is   required   in   the   Tableau   file   except   for   descriptive   text   used   in   the   visu-alisation   (e.g.,   labels).
• Upload an export of a packaged workbook of your visualisation before the assign-ment due date.
– Check   the   Tableau   Resources   page   on   Canvas   on   how   to   export   a   packaged   work-book   in   Tableau   Desktop

– Make   sure   that   you   have   tested   exporting   (and   re-opening) your   workbook   in   ad-   vance.
•   You   may   create   as   many   Sheets   in   Tableau   as   you   like   for   the   analysis,   but   only   upload one   Dashboard visualisation to Canvas.
